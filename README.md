# Flask Web-App Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Ray Images CNN 

# Pneumonia Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the **automatic detection of Pneumonia from chest X-ray images** using **Deep Learning techniques**. Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection, and early diagnosis plays a crucial role in effective treatment.

The system uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on a large dataset of chest X-ray images to classify whether a patient is affected by Pneumonia or not.

#### Model 
<pre>
In this Project i Trained my model on Google Colab and saved model in Models Folder.
You can put your trained model inside the Models folder to get better results just 
keep in mind the dimenssions of image feed to trained model if you want to take a 
look how i trained my model check this link
